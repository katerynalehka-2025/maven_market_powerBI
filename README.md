# maven_market_powerBI
Project overview

This project is an end-to-end Power BI dashboard developed independently using raw CSV datasets from Maven Analytics. The goal was to transform fragmented retail data into a structured analytical model and deliver actionable insights related to sales performance, profitability, returns, store efficiency, and customer behavior.
The project covers the full BI workflow: data loading, modeling, metric definition, and interactive dashboard design.

Business questions addressed

The dashboard answers key retail and business performance questions, including:
How are revenue, profit, transactions, and returns trending over time?
Are monthly performance metrics meeting business targets?
Which brands and products generate the highest profit?
How do individual stores perform in terms of revenue, profit, and return rate?
Which locations contribute most to total sales?
Who are the most valuable customers and how do they behave?
How does customer value differ by membership level and occupation?
